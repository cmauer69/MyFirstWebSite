<h1>First Web Page</h1>
    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>I might be new to web development, but I've learned a lot so far.</p>
    <h3>Basic HTML</h3>
    <p>I've also learned to write some of the most common HTML tags, and to write HTML for structure not appearance.  Some of the tags that I've learned include headings (&lt;h1&gt;,&lt;h2&gt;,&lt;h3&gt;,etc.),paragraph, and lists.  I've also learned to use special entity characters.</p>
    <h3>Favorite Things</h3>
    <p>The things I like best about this class are:
    <ol>
    <li>Replace this text with your favorite thing.</li>
    <li>Replace this text with your next favorite thing.</li>
    <li>Replace this text with another favorite thing.</li>
    <li>Feel free to add more, but you only need 3.</li>
    </ol></p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p1>I'm excited to learn more so that I can:
    <ul>
        <li>Replace this text with something you want to do with what you are learning.</li>
        <li>Replace this text with another something you want to do.</li>
        <li>Replace this text with another goal.</li>
        <li>Feel free to add more, but you only need 3.</li></ul></p1>
